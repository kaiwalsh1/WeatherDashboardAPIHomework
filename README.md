## Description 
Using a weather API, this weather dashboard application dynamically retrieves weather data. It allows you to search for cities and shows the current weather and a five day forecast. Searches are saved to local storage and a button for searching them again. 

## User Story
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
